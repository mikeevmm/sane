Description: # Sane
        
        Sane is Makefile for humans.
        
        ## Key Concepts
        
        - Recipes are python functions with recipe/file/hook dependencies.
        
        - Recipe dependencies are satisfied in the same fashion as Makefiles: if recipe
        A depends on file F1 and recipe B, and recipe B depends on file F2, then A is
        only ran if F1 is older than F2.
        
        - Recipes are ran if its dependency files are newer than its target files (or if
        either cannot be found).
        
        - Recipes with no dependencies are always ran.
        
        - Hooks are a way to tag dependencies. Recipes depending on a hook depend on all
        recipes with that hook.
        
        - Everything else is standard Python.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        All of `Sane` is contained in `sane.py`.
        
        With this file in your `PYTHONPATH` or the same directory:
        
        ```python
        # make.py
        
        from sane import *
        
        # ... Recipe definitions ...
        
        sane_run(default_recipe)
        ```
        
        then `python make.py` runs the default recipe. Call `python make.py --help` for
        more information.
        
        ## Example
        
        ```python
        import subprocess as sp
        from os import makedirs
        from glob import glob
        
        from sane import *
        
        CC = "gcc"
        EXE = "main"
        
        c_sources = glob("src/*.c")
        
        for sourcefile in c_sources:
            objectfile = sourcefile + '.o'
            @recipe(
                name=f"compile_{sourcefile}",
                hooks=["compilation"],
                target_files=[objectfile],
                file_deps=[sourcefile])
            def compile():
                makedirs("obj/", exist_ok=True)
                sp.run(f"{CC} -c {sourcefile} -o {objectfile}", shell=True)
        
        @recipe(hook_deps=["compilation"])
        def link():
            obj_files = ' '.join(glob("src/*.o"))
            sp.run(f"{CC} -o {EXE} {obj_files}", shell=True)
        
        sane_run(link)
        
        ```
        
        ## The `@recipe` Decorator
        
        ```python
        @recipe(
            name="...",
            hooks=[...],
            file_deps=[...],
            target_files=[...],
            recipe_deps=[...],
            hook_deps=[...])
        ```
        
        `name` - The name of the recipe (str). If none is given, the name is inferred
        from the associated function's name. Two recipes cannot share the same name.
        
        `hooks` - An array of hooks applicable to the recipe ([str]).
        
        `file_deps` - The file dependencies of this recipe ([str]). This recipe is ran
        if the newest of these files is newer that the oldest of the `target_files`.
        
        `target_files` - Files to check against `file_deps` ([str]).
        
        `recipe_deps` - The recipe dependencies of this recipe ([str or fn]); before
        running this recipe, these are checked. If any is ran, this recipe is ran.
        
        `hook_deps` - The hook dependencies of this recipe ([str]); before running this
        recipe, all recipes with any of these hooks are checked. If any is ran, this
        recipe is ran.
